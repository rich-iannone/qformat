# Information and Guidelines for Contributing to **qformat**

There are many ways to contribute to the ongoing development of the **qformat** package. Some contributions can be rather easy to do (e.g., fixing typos, improving documentation, filing issues for feature requests or problems, etc.) whereas other contributions can require more time and patience (like answering questions and submitting pull requests with code changes). Just know that that help provided in any capacity is very much appreciated. :)

## Filing Issues

If you believe you found a bug, create a minimal reproducible example for your posting to the [**qformat** issue tracker](https://github.com/rich-iannone/qformat/issues). Try not to include anything unnecessary, just the minimal amount of code that constitutes the reproducible bug. We will try to verify the bug by running the code in the example provided. The quality of the example will reduce the amount of back-and-forth communication in trying to understand how to execute the code on our systems.

### Making Pull Requests

Should you consider making a pull request (PR), please file an issue first and explain the problem in some detail. If the PR is an enhancement, detail how the change would make things better for package users. Bugfix PRs also require some explanation about the bug and how the proposed fix will remove that bug. A great way to illustrate the bug is to include a reproducible example. While all this upfront work prior to preparing a PR can be time-consuming it opens a line of communication with the package authors and the community, perhaps leading to better enhancement or more effective fixes!
